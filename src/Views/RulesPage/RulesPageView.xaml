                    Each MP used requires the wizard to sacrifice 5 HP (in addition to the 25 HP sacrifice required by the MEC effect–if the wearer also chooses to invoke the MEC effect) before casting the modified Spell. This sacrifice is an Instant Action. E.g., using three MPs on one Spell requires a single 15 HP sacrifice. Wizards may not die from MP usage as they currently must have at least one more hit point than the total hit points lost to the MP(s) used on a Spell. This HP sacrifice is a cost that must be paid before the modified Spell is cast. If the cost is not paid, the MP does not happen. I.e., you cannot mitigate the HP sacrifice. You can heal the HP sacrifice afterword, but you can’t prevent, negate, or reduce it at the time of the sacrifice. Wizards able to cast more than one Spell in a round may only use MP(s) on one of those Spells. However, they could use the MEC ability on one Spell and an MP on a different Spell.

This damage mitigation only affects the wizard. It can be used to reduce the damage the wizard receives from an AoE attack, but no other character’s damage gets mitigated. For every level of the sacrificed Spell, the amount of damage is reduced by 25 hit points. Thus, sacrificing a 1st-level Spell negates 25 damage, a 2nd-level Spell negates 50 damage, and a 3rd-level Spell negates 75 damage.

                    Wizards may channel the base damage of a Spell into the base damage of a single melee or missile attack made by an ally. If you use boost on a monk making a flurry of blows attack or a ranger making a dual-weapon melee attack, it can only affect one of the slides. It automatically affects the best of the two slides, as determined after all the pucks for that round have been slid. The wizard has the option to include bonus MEC damage or just the base damage of the Spell. If the Spell has a skill check and the skill check is successful, that extra damage is also included, but no other bonus damage can be channeled. If the targeted ally hits, the base damage of the Spell, skill check bonus (if applicable and successful) and, if desired, the MEC damage, is added to the base damage result of the slid weapon. No other damage modifiers to Spell damage are included with the use of boost. Damage channeled by boost is not subject to Spell Resistance or Magic Damage Reduction and is not negated if either the wizard or the targeted ally is in an anti-magic zone. If a channeled Spell requires a slide, the Spell’s slide is assumed to have hit without making an actual slide. However, the target ally is required to perform (and succeed on) an actual weapon attack slide.

                    Boost must be applied before the target makes their attack slide. Boost does not affect your ally’s To Hit modifier–only their damage is affected. If the ally misses, this use of boost is wasted.

                <Label Margin="8,0,8,10">
                    Unlike other AMPs, using boost does not technically cast a Spell. Instead of modifying a cast Spell, boost channels the raw arcane energy of what would have been a Spell into the kinetic energy of an ally’s weapon attack. E.g., using one of your castings of ray of shock to boost an ally’s hammer swing does not infuse the hammer with electricity, but if the hammer hits, it deals more blunt damage.

                    Boost cannot be used in conjunction with any other AMPs/MPs. In addition, boost can’t be used with another token’s effects. I.e., channeled boost damage may be used in conjunction with this token’s MEC ability and (if applicable) the Spell’s skill check bonus, but that’s it.

                    The recipient of boost can only benefit from one boost at a time. If the party has two wizards, the wizards cannot simultaneously boost a given target. The wizards could boost two different allies on the same round or boost the same target ally on different rounds.

                <Label Margin="8,0,8,10">
                    If the physical attack being boosted can affect more than one monster, only the initial target of the attack benefits from the boost. E.g., if a wizard uses boost on a fighter using double strike (from Viv’s Amulet of Noble Might), only the original target benefits from the extra damage from boost. Likewise for something like Fireseed Hickorynut.

                    If a monster has Spell Resistance, an intensified Spell reduces the target’s Spell Resistance to 25%, but only for the intensified Spell. This power does not affect any other Spells cast by the wizard nor other characters’ Spells.

                    Note: Intensify reduces the target’s existing SR to 25%, not by 25%. Using this MP on a target with SR of 25% or less does nothing and would be a waste.

                    Allows the modified Spell to be cast as an Instant Action–but only during the wizard’s turn.  Thus, in some circumstances, it might be possible to cast three Spells in a single round: one as a Standard Action, one as a Free Action, and one as an Instant Action. When quicken is used, the wearer mentally channels the casting of the spell through the medallion. The result of this channeling allows the medallion to cast the Spell by proxy and as an Instant Action. The Spell still gets marked off the player’s class card, but since the medallion is doing the work of casting, the wearer’s hands are free to do other things (e.g., cast another Spell as a Standard Action, make a weapon attack, drink a potion, etc.) Spells cast in this manner are not “cast as a scroll” and may be modified.

                    Note: Unlike all other Mage Powers, quicken does not expend the caster’s Free Action for the round–unless another Mage Power is used on the same Spell. When quicken is used in conjunction with another Mage Power, the caster’s Free Action is consumed.

                    The Spell modified by this MP can crit on a natural 18-20. It may only be used on a Spell that requires a To Hit slide. This power must be announced before the player performs the affected Spell’s attack slide.

                    Note: Sharpen is not effective against creatures you cannot critically hit. This includes, but is not limited to creatures without a vital anatomy, Constructs, incorporeal creatures, Oozes, Plants, and Undead. However, if you are able to overcome a creature’s crit immunity, sharpen is effective against that creature.
